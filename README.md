# Simple Java Calculator

This is a basic console-based calculator application implemented in Java. The application performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run this application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. If not, download it from the official Oracle [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Directory Structure

The project follows this directory structure:


project_directory
```
│ Main.java
└───Calculator
    │ Calculator.java
```

### How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory where `Main.java` is located.

2. Compile the Java files using the command: `javac Main.java Calculator/Calculator.java`.

3. Run the application using the command: `java Main`.

On execution, the application prompts you to input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). After input, the application displays the result of the operation on the console.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main files:

1. `Main.java` - This is the entry point of the application. It handles user input and output.

2. `Calculator/Calculator.java` - This file contains the `Calculator` class, which implements the basic arithmetic operations.
